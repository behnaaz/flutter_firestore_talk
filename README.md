## Creating the Firestore database
Coming soon!

## Loading the database with seed data
There is a fantastic and free API service that will provide realistic-looking but fake randomized JSON data that looks like users -- [RandomUser.me](https://randomuser.me/documentation). We're using their API to load the database.

The Node script to load this data can be found in the [load_people folder](./load_people) in this repository. By default it loads 10 people.

1.
1. Open a command window.
1. cd load_people
1. node load_people.js
